Tracks the number of cars entering and leaving a parking lot, showing available slots.
##NOTE
Building a basic car parking automation system on Vivado (using FPGAs) is an exciting project that combines hardware description languages (HDLs) like VHDL or Verilog with digital logic design. This type of system could be designed for tasks such as detecting available parking spots, guiding cars into parking spaces, and monitoring parking occupancy.

Here’s an overview of the steps and components you'll need for such a project.

### Steps for Building a Basic Car Parking Automation System on Vivado:

#### 1. **Define the System Requirements**
   - **Input Signals**:
     - Sensors to detect the presence of cars (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors, or cameras).
     - Manual control inputs (if needed, e.g., for system testing or override).
   - **Output Signals**:
     - LED indicators to show whether a parking spot is occupied or available.
     - Servo motors or stepper motors for moving a barrier or guiding a car into the parking spot.
     - A display system (e.g., 7-segment displays, or an LCD for showing parking status).
   - **System Behavior**:
     - Detect free and occupied spots.
     - Assign parking spots to incoming cars.
     - Provide guiding signals (e.g., lights, arrows) to help drivers park in available spots.
     - Monitor parking area status in real-time.

#### 2. **Choose the Components**
   To implement a basic car parking automation system, you'll need both hardware and software components:
   - **FPGA Development Board** (e.g., Xilinx Spartan-6, Artix-7, or Zynq).
   - **Sensors**: Ultrasonic distance sensors or IR sensors to detect whether a parking spot is occupied.
   - **Motors**: Stepper motors or servo motors for mechanical control (e.g., to open/close barriers).
   - **Display**: 7-segment display or an LED matrix for showing the status.
   - **Power Supply**: Ensure a reliable and stable power source for both the FPGA and the motors/sensors.

#### 3. **Design the Digital Logic**
   In Vivado, you’ll need to design the digital logic using either VHDL or Verilog. The primary tasks you need to implement are:

   - **Sensor Interface**:
     - Connect and configure ultrasonic sensors to detect car presence.
     - Interface with GPIO pins on the FPGA to get data from the sensors.
     - Create logic to debounce or filter out noisy sensor signals.

   - **Parking Spot Management**:
     - Use a finite state machine (FSM) or other logic to track the status of each parking spot (free/occupied).
     - Create logic to assign a parking spot to a car and update its status.
     - Display the status of the parking lot (free spots, occupied spots) on an LED or 7-segment display.

   - **Servo Motor Control**:
     - If you are controlling barriers or guiding the car into the parking spot, use PWM (pulse-width modulation) signals to control servo motors.
     - For a more sophisticated design, you could control stepper motors for more precise movements.
   
   - **Display Output**:
     - Create logic for driving the display (LEDs or 7-segment displays) to indicate parking spot status.

#### 4. **Write the Code (VHDL/Verilog)**
   Here’s a rough idea of the components you'd code in VHDL or Verilog:

   - **Sensor Input Logic**:
     ```vhdl
     -- Example VHDL to read from an ultrasonic sensor
     PROCESS (clk)
     BEGIN
        IF rising_edge(clk) THEN
            -- Read the sensor data here (distance)
            car_detected <= sensor_input;  -- Simple logic for car detection
        END IF;
     END PROCESS;
     ```

   - **Parking Spot Logic (FSM or State Machine)**:
     ```vhdl
     -- FSM for managing parking spots (free/occupied)
     PROCESS (clk)
     BEGIN
        IF rising_edge(clk) THEN
            CASE state IS
                WHEN idle =>
                    IF car_detected = '1' THEN
                        state <= park_car;
                    END IF;
                WHEN park_car =>
                    -- logic for assigning a parking spot and guiding the car
                    state <= occupied;
                WHEN occupied =>
                    -- Show status on LEDs
                    spot_status <= '1'; -- Parking spot occupied
                WHEN others =>
                    state <= idle;
            END CASE;
        END IF;
     END PROCESS;
     ```

   - **Servo Motor PWM Control**:
     ```vhdl
     -- PWM generation for controlling a servo motor
     PROCESS (clk)
     BEGIN
        IF rising_edge(clk) THEN
            IF pwm_counter < pwm_duty THEN
                pwm_out <= '1';  -- Servo active
            ELSE
                pwm_out <= '0';  -- Servo inactive
            END IF;

            pwm_counter <= pwm_counter + 1;
            IF pwm_counter >= pwm_max THEN
                pwm_counter <= 0;
            END IF;
        END IF;
     END PROCESS;
     ```

#### 5. **Simulation**
   - Before programming your FPGA, simulate the design to check for logical errors. Vivado provides a built-in simulator that allows you to test your VHDL/Verilog code.
   - You can use testbenches to simulate the sensor inputs and monitor the output signals like the servo control and parking spot status.

#### 6. **Synthesize and Implement**
   - Once the simulation passes, synthesize your design in Vivado to convert it to FPGA configuration.
   - Implement the design, which will map the logic to the FPGA's hardware resources (LUTs, flip-flops, etc.).
   - Generate the bitstream and upload it to the FPGA board.

#### 7. **Test on Hardware**
   - Once the design is loaded onto the FPGA, connect the sensors, motors, and display to the FPGA board.
   - Test the system by simulating car movements and verifying if the parking automation works as expected.

### Additional Features You Could Add:
- **Multiple Parking Spots**: Manage multiple sensors for multiple parking spots, updating the status for each one.
- **Real-Time Display**: Use a more complex display (e.g., an LCD screen) to show more detailed information.
- **Advanced Control**: Add features like automated barrier control when a car approaches, or even a simple robotic arm to guide the car into the spot.

### Tools You’ll Need:
- **Vivado Design Suite**: For creating and testing your FPGA designs.
- **Xilinx FPGA Board** (e.g., Nexys, Basys, or a Zynq board).
- **Sensors** (e.g., ultrasonic, IR).
- **Motors** (for barriers or guiding cars).

### Conclusion:
This basic automation system involves creating a digital logic design that interfaces with hardware components like sensors, motors, and displays. Using Vivado and FPGA hardware, you can create a functional car parking automation system that detects parking spots, guides cars, and manages parking lot occupancy.
